    <td>Consider a telephone book database of N clients. Make use of a hash table implementation
to quickly look up clientâ€˜s telephone number. Make use of two collision handling
techniques and compare them using number of comparisons required to find a set of
telephone numbers (Python)</td>

using chaining with / without replacement.<br>

must be unique Standard Operations: Insert(key, value), Find(key), Delete(key) (python)</td>

    <td>There are flight paths between cities. If there is a flight between city A and city B then
there is an edge between the cities. The cost of the edge can be the time that flight take
to reach city B from A, or the amount of fuel used for the journey. Represent this as a
graph. The node can be represented by airport name or name of the city. Use adjacency
list representation of the graph or use adjacency matrix representation of the graph.
Check whether the graph is connected or not. Justify the storage representation used.</td>

up with each other; and the phone company charges different amounts of money to
connect different pairs of cities. You want a set of lines that connects all your offices with
a minimum total cost. Solve the problem by suggesting appropriate data structures.</td>

operating system does not use priorities, then the jobs are processed
in the order they enter the system. Write C++ program for simulating
job queue. Write functions to add job and delete job from queue.</td>
